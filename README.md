# InStock Client

A React + TypeScript warehouse and inventory management system built with Vite. This project was originally completed as a group assignment during my BrainStation bootcamp. I chose to rebuild it independently using TypeScript and PostgreSQL (hosted on Supabase) to deepen my understanding of all aspects of full-stack development, rather than just the components I worked on in the group project.

- Practice TypeScript with React
- Implement CRUD operations with a REST API
- Build a responsive UI using SASS
- Learn effective state management in React
- Gain experience with form validation and error handling
- Work with PostgreSQL and Supabase
